    <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>I have been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. Since I started high school, I was the go-to IT person for my family, I set up Wi-Fi modems, network printers, computers, and was the person to ask if anyone was having any trouble with anything. As I learned more and more about computers and the IT field in general, I gradually reached the point where I realised just how much I didnâ€™t know or understand at all.  The real moment when I decided I was going to go back to UNI and study IT was after listening to a guest lecturer speak about cybercrime in the last year of my other degree. The whole lecture fascinated me, and I realised that I really wanted to learn more. </p>

    <p>I chose to study at RMIT mostly because I knew I wanted to study online. I think online learning gives you much more flexibility than needing to attend lectures and classes in person. I chose RMIT specifically because, of all the online IT degrees I looked at, theirs was the one that looked the most well rounded and interesting.</p>

    <p>I hope to learn everything I can about programming and security. I think those are the topics that interest me the most at the moment, but as I learn more about the other fields available that may change.</p>
