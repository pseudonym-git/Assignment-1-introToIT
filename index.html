    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Perth, Western Australia 23 years ago. The highest level of education that I have achieved to date is a Bachelor’s degree in Criminology, where my major was Criminal Behaviour, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Global Security, where my major was Terrorism and Counterterrorism Studies. My favourite hobby at the moment is playing tennis.</p>

    <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>I have been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. Since I started high school, I was the go-to IT person for my family, I set up Wi-Fi modems, network printers, computers, and I could generally help if anyone was having any trouble with anything. Over the years as I learned more and more about computers and the IT field in general, I gradually reached the point where I realised just how much I didn’t know or understand at all.  The real moment when I decided I was going to go back to UNI and study IT was after listening to a guest lecturer speak about cybercrime in the last year of my other degree. The whole lecture fascinated me, and I realised that I really wanted to learn more.</p>

    <p>I chose to study at RMIT mostly because I knew I wanted to study online. I think online learning gives you much more flexibility than needing to attend lectures and classes in person. I chose RMIT specifically because, of all the online IT degrees I looked at, theirs was the one that looked the most well rounded and interesting.</p>

    <p>I hope to learn everything I can about programming and security. I think those are the topics that interest me the most at the moment, but as I learn more about the other fields available that may change.</p>

    <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>My Ideal Job at the moment would be something like <link rel="this" href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52550393?type=standout#searchRequestToken=cbb1ff1c-d664-4e4d-9811-f1d4a70b7dca">
      This role is working for the South Australian Police Financial and Cybercrime Investigation Branch, and involves identifying, recovering, and investigating evidence of digital evidence in crimes. The requirement of the position is a tertiary degree in IT or a related discipline, which I will have at the conclusion of this current degree with further training to be conducted on the job. This job appeals to me as it combines a number of my interests and past and present study into one job. I have already a solid foundation law and requirements for evidence from my criminology degree, and the role directly engages with the area that inspired me to study IT. I believe that I could apply for a job like this as soon as I graduate as I will have met the necessary requirements.</p>

      <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
      <p>My project idea is for a questionnaire program that runs in the Python shell to calculate the user’s actual risk of being a victim of a crime. To almost everyone, criminology students included, crime statistics are hard to understand and practically meaningless to apply to anyone. My program idea would change that by asking the user questions, and using those responses, interpreting the actual risk as a percentage using crime statistics stored as variables. This would mean that each user would get an accurate picture of their risk of crime based on data like the demographic they are in, the suburb they live in, whether they have been a victim of a crime recently, etc. I also intend for this program to, also based on user responses, print a list of the crimes that the user will most likely be a victim of and give suggestions to reduce their risk of crime. It could also return links to explanations of criminology theory if the user is interested.</p>

      <p>My motivation to create this program comes from my experience studying fear of crime in criminology, and from my experience in moving house. Fear of crime is essentially the public’s perception of their likelihood of being a victim of a crime. Both conventional media like newspapers and news programs, and social media have been shown to increase fear of crime far beyond the actual risk. One of the first things I did when moving house was to look at crime statistics in the area I was going to move to. I know I’m not alone in doing this as my girlfriend’s mum also looked at them when she was considering moving too. You hear it all the time when someone is moving; “Is that a good area” so when this assignment came along, I thought of doing something like this straight away.</p>

      <p>My program, which would run from the python shell, would ask the user questions. User answers would trigger an if condition, which would then determine which variable would be assigned to their risk percentage. Each answer that they give would either increase or decrease their risk. At the end of the questionnaire the program would print their risk as a percentage, along with a list of the top 3 crimes that they are most likely to be a victim of, and, based on this list, suggestions on how to reduce their risk. For example: if a user enters that they are male, 18-25, and live in Armadale in Western Australia, the program will look at what crime statistics are applicable to males of that age range, in that area. It would then print the 5 crimes that the user is most likely to be a victim of and display them, most likely violent crimes like assault. It would then give a suggestion on how to minimise the risk of assault, for example, ‘avoid bars and places where alcohol is served, especially on days where there is a UFC or Boxing match being played there’. </p>

      <p>In terms of tools and technologies that are required to create my project, it is really simple. Initially requiring only, the python shell and a text editor to run and program, and GitHub to collaborate with other team members. It could be created as an app with a Graphical User Interface while retaining the same questionnaire style, but I am not sure how that would be created. </p>

      <p>The skills required to create my project are fairly straightforward too. For the initial idea to run the program in the python shell I think it could be done with the skills I and others have already learned in the Introduction to Programming unit at RMIT. The complex part of the project, at least from my perspective, would be creating the GUI. </p>

      <p>My hope for this program is to make crime statistics actually accessible to everyone who is interested without the extra work of trawling through everything published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I hope the project would also make the statistics relevant to the user, instead of just being abstract. I think that a personalised estimate of a person’s risk of crime would help with the phenomenon of fear of crime in the community. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I hope that the suggestions given by the program can do some good and prevent crimes. </p>
