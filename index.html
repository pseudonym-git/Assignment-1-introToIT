<h3>Hello there</h3>

  <p>Hello there, my name is Andrew McKenna</p>

  <h2>My Project Idea</h2>

  <p>My idea is for a program that gives the user an accurate estimate of the possibility of them being a victim of a crime. It would do this by prompting the user to enter deatils about their identity and the context that they are in, or are preparing to go into, and comparing their responses to Australian crime statistics.</p>

  <p>I believe that this kind of program would be useful for the following reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>As has been shown in many studies, media, including social media, often leaves people with an outsized idea of their own risk of being a victim of a crime.</li>
      <li>It could be used to help people understand the risk of buying houses in a given area.</li>
      <li>The program could help people understand steps that they could take to reduce the risk of crime.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
